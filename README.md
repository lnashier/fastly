# Fastly

## Purpose

This repository contains code examples/resources that I use in knowledge-sharing sessions. I usually present the code
from the repository, walk through it, explain its functionality, and discuss relevant Golang concepts and practices.
This hands-on approach allows participants to see real-world examples and gain practical insights into Golang
development. By using this repository as a teaching tool, I can provide concrete examples that participants can study,
analyze, and even experiment with on their own. I have noticed, this fosters better understanding and retention of Golang concepts.
